	I am a PhD student in the Computer Science and Engineering department of IIT Delhi. I am advised by [http://manikvarma.org Dr. Manik Varma]. My primary research area is [http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html Extreme Multi-Label Classification], which is a sub-field of machine learning. I have designed and implemented several state-of-the-art extreme classification algorithms which can be useful in a wide range of web applications such as large-scale image classification, web-page tagging, product recommendation, computational advertising, and so on.

	[http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html The Extreme Classification Repository] is a one-stop resource center for extreme classification researchers. It provides datasets, code for baseline algorithms, benchmark results, information about evaluation metrics, and many more useful stuff.

	Prior to joining the PhD program, I spent 2 wonderful years as a Research Assistant in the Machine Learning and Optimization group of [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/ Microsoft Research India]. I graduated with B.Tech.(Hons) degree from [https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/ CSE, IIT Bombay] in 2011.

	My CV is available [CV.pdf here].
